Frame of eggs added from the blue hive.

Configuration: D, QE, S, S, QE, D

Uncapped queen cells found, apply swarm control. [Demaree](/glossary#demaree) method applied. Deep boxes swapped, queen found and moved to bottom box.

Check again after 4 days to knock down queen cells.

### Brown Nuc

Queen found and marked blue. Brood in all stages, adequate stores.

### Green Nuc.

Queen and has the appearance of being mated but no eggs or brood seen so no evidence she's begun laying. Nuc completely without stores, frame of capped honey given from the Green hive plus thin sugar syrup.
