I'm an amateur bee keeper in the LS8 area of Leeds who keeps a couple of bee hives in the garden at home. Intermittently through the summer I have small batches of locally produced honey for sale.

If you'd like to get notified of when we have honey for sale, the easiest way is to follow our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093598976055)

### [ The Queens ]({% link queens/index.md %})

As an amateur beekeper with only a coupple of hives our queens are more like pets. Here you can meet the most important bees in the apiary, the queens.
