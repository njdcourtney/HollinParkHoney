Honey! The reason that bee keepers put up with all the stings.

From the hive our honey is spun out of the combs using an extractor, passed through a filter to remove any bits of wax, allowed to stand for a day to allow and air bubbles to escape and then put into jars.

That's it. No blending, no heat treatment, just pure honey from the hive.

Honey produced in the UK must follow the [Honey regulations 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1348/made) and every jar should be labelled with a batch number and a best before date. Here you can look up details of all the batches of honey we've produced and the details of when they were extracted.
