title: Checking for queens

4pm, 16C, Sunny.  

Routine inspection to check for laying queens.

### Green Hive

Configuration: D, QE, D, QE, S, S

No sign of a laying queen. As this is [Demaree](/glossary#demaree) +26 days I'll leave it one more week. If not seen next week I'll assume she's lost.

### Blue Hive

Configuration: D, QE, S, S, QE, D

Queen seen and brood in all stages.

They're not drawing out comb very well, probably because of the drought and the dearth of nectar. Leave them alone to build back up.

### Brown Nuc

Queen and eggs seen. Queen to be marked at next inspection.

### Green Nuc.

Queen seen, no eggs or brood. Queen looks small and quick moving so assume still unmated.
