This was my bi-annual inspection by Kay Phillips the [Seasonal Bee Inspector](https://www.nationalbeeunit.com/about-us/apiary-inspection-programme/the-statutory-apiary-inspection-programme-2#).

I didn't take detailed notes because I was busy helping Kay do her job, but the good news is my bees got a clean bill of health.

### Green Hive

Virgin Queen seen - leave to get mated.

### Blue Hive

Queen seen and begun to lay in the bottom box.

### Brown Nuc

No queen or eggs seen.

### Green Nuc.

Sealed queen cell seen.
