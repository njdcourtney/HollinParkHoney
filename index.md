<p class="lead text-center">Welcome to Hollin Park Honey</p>

I'm an amateur bee keeper in the LS8 area of Leeds who keeps a couple of bee hives in the garden at home. I'm a member of [Leeds Beekeeping Association](https://www.leedsbeekeepers.org.uk/) and intermittently through the summer I have small batches of locally produced honey for sale.

If you'd like to get notified of when we have honey for sale, the easiest way is to follow our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093598976055)

### [ Honey ]({% link honey.md %})

Find details of the batches of honey we're produced in the past for an idea of when we may have honey available in the future.

### [ The Queens ]({% link queens.md %})

As an amateur beekeper with only a coupple of hives our queens are more like pets. Here you can meet the most important bees in the apiary, the queens.


### Swarms

If you have a swarm of honey bees your local beekeeping association may be able to help you.

Firstly you should confirm whether you indeed have honey bees, the British beekeeping association have a handy [bee identification guide](https://www.bbka.org.uk/identification)

If you're sure you have honey bees, then in Leeds you can contact the [LBKA swarm coordinator](https://www.leedsbeekeepers.org.uk/swarms), further afield you may be able to find a local swarm collection on this [swarm collectors page](https://www.bbka.org.uk/find-a-local-swarm-collector) from BBKA.

Please note that all swarm collection services are run by volunteers who have day jobs and other commitments, so please be patient if it takes a while for somebody to respond.
