### Demaree

The Demaree method of swarm control, sometimes called a vertical split.  
It works by moving the brood and eggs above the supers with the queen in the bottom brood box with empty drawn comb or foundation.

There's a more detailed description of the Demaree method on the [Barnsley Beekeepers website](https://barnsleybeekeepers.org.uk/the-demaree-method/)
